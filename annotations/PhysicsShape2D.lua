---@class PhysicsShape2D @Represents an efficient low-level physics shape used by the physics engine.
---@field vertexStartIndex fun() @The start index for the geometry of this shape within the PhysicsShapeGroup2D.
---@field radius fun() @The radius of the shape.
---@field adjacentEnd fun() @Defines the position of a virtual point adjacent to the end vertex of an edge shape.
---@field adjacentStart fun() @Defines the position of a virtual point adjacent to the start vertex of an edge shape.
---@field vertexCount fun() @The total number of vertices used to represent the shape type.
---@field shapeType fun() @The shape type determines how the vertices and radius are used by this PhysicsShape2D.
---@field useAdjacentStart fun() @When the value is true, then the shape will use the adjacentStart feature. When the value is false, then the shape will not use the adjacentStart feature.
---@field useAdjacentEnd fun() @When the value is true, then the shape will use the adjacentEnd feature. When the value is false, then the shape will not use the adjacentEnd feature.
