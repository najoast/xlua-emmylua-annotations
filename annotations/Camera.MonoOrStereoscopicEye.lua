---@class Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye @A Camera eye corresponding to the left or right human eye for stereoscopic rendering, or neither for non-stereoscopic rendering.A single Camera can render both left and right views in a single frame. Therefore, this enum describes which eye the Camera is currently rendering when returned by Camera.stereoActiveEye during a rendering callback (such as Camera.OnRenderImage), or which eye to act on when passed into a function.The default value is Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Left, so Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Left may be returned by some methods or properties when called outside of rendering if stereoscopic rendering is enabled.
---@field Right fun() @Camera eye corresponding to stereoscopic rendering of the right eye.
---@field Mono fun() @Camera eye corresponding to non-stereoscopic rendering.
---@field Left fun() @Camera eye corresponding to stereoscopic rendering of the left eye.
