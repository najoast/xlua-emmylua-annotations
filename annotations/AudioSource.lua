---@class AudioSource @A representation of audio sources in 3D.
---@field maxDistance fun() @(Logarithmic rolloff) MaxDistance is the distance a sound stops attenuating at.
---@field outputAudioMixerGroup fun() @The target group to which the AudioSource should route its signal.
---@field loop fun() @Is the audio clip looping?
---@field panLevel fun() @PanLevel has been deprecated. Use spatialBlend instead.
---@field priority fun() @Sets the priority of the AudioSource.
---@field pan fun() @Pan has been deprecated. Use panStereo instead.
---@field reverbZoneMix fun() @The amount by which the signal from the AudioSource will be mixed into the global reverb associated with the Reverb Zones.
---@field pitch fun() @The pitch of the audio source.
---@field UnPause fun() @Unpause the paused playback of this AudioSource.
---@field Stop fun() @Stops playing the clip.
---@field SetSpatializerFloat fun() @Sets a user-defined parameter of a custom spatializer effect that is attached to an AudioSource.
---@field bypassReverbZones fun() @When set doesn't route the signal from an AudioSource into the global reverb associated with reverb zones.
---@field SetScheduledStartTime fun() @Changes the time at which a sound that has already been scheduled to play will start.
---@field Play fun() @Plays the clip.
---@field SetCustomCurve fun() @Set the custom curve for the given AudioSourceCurveType.
---@field clip fun() @The default AudioClip to play.
---@field SetAmbisonicDecoderFloat fun() @Sets a user-defined parameter of a custom ambisonic decoder effect that is attached to an AudioSource.
---@field isPlaying fun() @Is the clip playing right now (Read Only)?
---@field panStereo fun() @Pans a playing sound in a stereo way (left or right). This only applies to sounds that are Mono or Stereo.
---@field bypassEffects fun() @Bypass effects (Applied from filter components or global listener filters).
---@field bypassListenerEffects fun() @When set global effects on the AudioListener will not be applied to the audio signal generated by the AudioSource. Does not apply if the AudioSource is playing into a mixer group.
---@field PlayScheduled fun() @Plays the clip at a specific time on the absolute time-line that AudioSettings.dspTime reads from.
---@field PlayOnGamepad fun() @Enable playing of audio source though a specfic gamepad.
---@field GamepadSpeakerOutputType fun() @Gamepad audio output types.
---@field Pause fun() @Pauses playing the clip.
---@field PlayClipAtPoint fun() @Plays an AudioClip at a given position in world space.
---@field playOnAwake fun() @If set to true, the audio source will automatically start playing on awake.
---@field rolloffMode fun() @Sets/Gets how the AudioSource attenuates over distance.
---@field PlayDelayed fun() @Plays the clip with a delay specified in seconds. Users are advised to use this function instead of the old Play(delay) function that took a delay specified in samples relative to a reference rate of 44.1 kHz as an argument.
---@field SetScheduledEndTime fun() @Changes the time at which a sound that has already been scheduled to play will end. Notice that depending on the timing not all rescheduling requests can be fulfilled.
---@field minDistance fun() @Within the Min distance the AudioSource will cease to grow louder in volume.
---@field isVirtual fun() @True if all sounds played by the AudioSource (main sound started by Play() or playOnAwake as well as one-shots) are culled by the audio system.
---@field GetSpatializerFloat fun() @Reads a user-defined parameter of a custom spatializer effect that is attached to an AudioSource.
---@field GetOutputData fun() @Provides a block of the currently playing source's output data.
---@field PlayOneShot fun() @Plays an AudioClip, and scales the AudioSource volume by volumeScale.
---@field GamepadSpeakerSupportsOutputType fun() @Check if the platform supports an audio output type  on gamepads.
---@field GetAmbisonicDecoderFloat fun() @Reads a user-defined parameter of a custom ambisonic decoder effect that is attached to an AudioSource.
---@field GetCustomCurve fun() @Get the current custom curve for the given AudioSourceCurveType.
---@field DisableGamepadOutput fun() @Disables audio output to a gamepad for this audio source.
---@field volume fun() @The volume of the audio source (0.0 to 1.0).
---@field velocityUpdateMode fun() @Whether the Audio Source should be updated in the fixed or dynamic update.
---@field GetSpectrumData fun() @Provides a block of the currently playing audio source's spectrum data.
---@field time fun() @Playback position in seconds.
---@field spatialBlend fun() @Sets how much this AudioSource is affected by 3D spatialisation calculations (attenuation, doppler etc). 0.0 makes the sound full 2D, 1.0 makes it full 3D.
---@field dopplerLevel fun() @Sets the Doppler scale for this AudioSource.
---@field timeSamples fun() @Playback position in PCM samples.
---@field ignoreListenerVolume fun() @This makes the audio source not take into account the volume of the audio listener.
---@field spread fun() @Sets the spread angle (in degrees) of a 3d stereo or multichannel sound in speaker space.
---@field mute fun() @Un- / Mutes the AudioSource. Mute sets the volume=0, Un-Mute restore the original volume.
---@field gamepadSpeakerOutputType fun() @Gets or sets the gamepad audio output type for this audio source.
---@field spatialize fun() @Enables or disables spatialization.
---@field spatializePostEffects fun() @Determines if the spatializer effect is inserted before or after the effect filters.
---@field ignoreListenerPause fun() @Allows AudioSource to play even though AudioListener.pause is set to true. This is useful for the menu element sounds or background music in pause menus.
