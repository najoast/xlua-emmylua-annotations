---@class UIElements.EventBase @The base class for all UIElements events.
---@field timestamp fun() @The time when the event was created.
---@field PreventDefault fun() @Indicates whether the default actions are prevented from being executed for this event.
---@field isImmediatePropagationStopped fun() @Indicates whether StopImmediatePropagation() was called for this event.
---@field dispatch fun() @Indicates whether the event is being dispatched to a visual element. An event cannot be redispatched while it being dispatched. If you need to recursively dispatch an event, it is recommended that you use a copy of the event.
---@field isPropagationStopped fun() @Whether StopPropagation() was called for this event.
---@field originalMousePosition fun() @The original mouse position of the IMGUI event, before it is transformed to the current target local coordinates.
---@field isDefaultPrevented fun() @Returns true if the default actions should not be executed for this event.
---@field pooled fun() @Whether the event is allocated from a pool of events.
---@field tricklesDown fun() @Returns whether this event is sent down the event propagation path during the TrickleDown phase.
---@field StopImmediatePropagation fun() @Immediately stops the propagation of the event. The event isn't sent to other elements along the propagation path. This method prevents other event handlers from executing on the current target.
---@field StopPropagation fun() @Stops propagating this event. The event is not sent to other elements along the propagation path. This method does not prevent other event handlers from executing on the current target.
---@field PreDispatch fun() @
---@field propagationPhase fun() @The current propagation phase.
---@field RegisterEventType fun() @Registers an event class to the event type system.
---@field currentTarget fun() @The current target of the event. This is the VisualElement, in the propagation path, for which event handlers are currently being executed.
---@field eventTypeId fun() @Retrieves the type ID for this event instance.
---@field PostDispatch fun() @
---@field Init fun() @Resets all event members to their initial values.
---@field Dispose fun() @Implementation of IDisposable.
---@field target fun() @The target visual element that received this event. Unlike currentTarget, this target does not change when the event is sent to other elements along the propagation path.
---@field bubbles fun() @Returns whether this event type bubbles up in the event propagation path.
---@field imguiEvent fun() @The IMGUIEvent at the source of this event. The source can be null since not all events are generated by IMGUI.
