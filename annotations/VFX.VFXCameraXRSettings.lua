---@class VFX.VFXCameraXRSettings @Represents settings that specify how the Visual Effect Graph should handle an XR Camera.
---@field viewOffset fun() @Indicates where to start rendering views in this pass. Currently, the Visual Effect Graph uses this for multiple pass XR rendering. In this case, the first pass value is 0 and the second pass is 1. For other XR rendering methods, this is 0.
---@field viewTotal fun() @The number of views the camera has in total. For a normal Camera, this is 1. For a Camera in XR, this is 2.
---@field viewCount fun() @The number of views to render in the pass. In Unity, there are different methods of rendering a Camera in XR. For multiple pass rendering, viewTotal is 2 and viewCount will be 1. For other XR rendering methods, both viewTotal and viewCount are 2.
