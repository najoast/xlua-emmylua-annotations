---@class AssetImporters.TextureGenerationOutput @Structure that represents the result from calling TextureGenerator.GenerateTexture.
---@field texture fun() @This is a Texture2D generated by TextureGenerator.GenerateTexture based on the colorBuffer argument passed to that function.                If the generator is configured to generate a non-2D texture (cubemap, 3D, ...), this member will always be null. To get the result for an arbitrary texture type, please use the TextureGenerationOutput.output property.                We recommend always using TextureGenerationOutput.output  as the texture property will deprecated/removed in the future.
---@field sprites fun() @Sprites that are generated by TextureGenerator.GenerateTexture from TextureGenerationSettings.spriteSheetData.
---@field importWarnings fun() @TextureGenerator.GenerateTexture reports warnings when you generate a Texture.
---@field thumbNail fun() @Thumbnail version of the generated texture. This may be null depending on the import settings. E.g. cubemaps will not return a thumbnail.
---@field importInspectorWarnings fun() @Warnings that should be shown in Inspector after generating a Texture.
---@field output fun() @This is a Texture generated by TextureGenerator.GenerateTexture based on the colorBuffer argument passed to that function.                The actual texture type (2D, 3D, cubemap,..) depends on the TextureImporterSettings.textureShape settings of the generator.
